# EDA_Project_IMDb_Movie_Ratings
EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis.
It is an approach to summarize data statically and get useful insights out of the data. 
In this Assignment I have Performed EDA on the Movies dataset, containing the top 100 rated movies data. 
The goal of this assignment is to organize and filter data along with removing all the errors and finding the relationship between data to get useful insight out of this dataset.
